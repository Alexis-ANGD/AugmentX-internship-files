# AugmentX-internship-files

This repository contains all the files mentioned in my internship report, divided into two categories :
those concerning the Central Unit and those concerning the German Bionic CrayX motor control signal recovery system.

These two categories are therefore each entitled to a sub-repository in which the files are once again classified into two categories : 
the 3D design files for the parts that have been printed, and the python files enabling the two systems to operate.
